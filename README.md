Here is an example README.md file that could be included with the RabbitMQ Python code:

# RabbitMQ Best Practices Example

This project shows an example implementation of various messaging best practices using RabbitMQ and Pika in Python.

## Overview

The code demonstrates:

- Use of durable queues, exchanges and bindings for reliability 
- Manual consumer acknowledgements to confirm delivery
- Persistent messages with correlation ids for tracing 
- Dead letter queues to handle failures
- Graceful connection and channel closure  

It shows a typical best practice flow:

- Declare durable exchange, queue, bindings
- Publish persistent messages to exchange
- Consume messages from queue and process 
- Send acknowledgements on successful processing
- Handle failures by diverting messages to a DLQ

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Requires Python and RabbitMQ server installed

### Running

To try out basic messaging:

```
python applying_best_practices.py 
```
